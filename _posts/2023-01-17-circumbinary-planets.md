How do planets form around binary stars? The answer lies in their migration due to interactions with the protoplanetary disc. 🌌🪐 #Astrophysics #PlanetFormation  

Direct hydrodynamical simulations are costly, but N-body simulations offer a more affordable way to study circumbinary planet migration. 🌟💻 #AstroSimulation #NBodySimulations  

Eccentricity of the binary is the most important parameter in determining the capture of circumbinary exoplanets near low-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs). 🪐🔭 #Astrophysics #Exoplanets  

A new study using N-body simulations identifies 4/1 MMR as the most prone to capture exoplanets, followed by 5/1 MMR. 🤯🌌 #AstroSimulation #PlanetFormation  

Understanding how planets migrate within circumbinary discs is crucial for knowing where and for how long they can survive around binary stars. 🚀🪐 #Astrophysics #PlanetSurvival
