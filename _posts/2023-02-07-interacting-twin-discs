"Did you know that dense stellar environments increase the probability of gravitational encounters? Learn how these interactions manifest in disc structures around individual stars in our latest research!" #stellarinteractions #discstructures #astrophysics

"Spirals and connecting filaments between stars? Yes, please! Check out our near-infrared polarized light observations of three known interacting twin-disc systems and see the stunning images for yourself." #starconnections #nearinfrared #astrophotography

"What do local angles of linear polarization tell us about interacting twin-disc systems? Find out in our latest research, where we analyze complex polarized intensity and explore the presence of multiple light sources in these systems." #linearpolarization #twindiscs #astrophysics

"Sometimes, the incoherent summation of multiple light sources can produce nulls of polarized intensity in an image. See how this phenomenon is potentially observed in AS 205 and learn more about the geometry and content of these systems." #polarizedintensity #nulls #astrophysics

"Collective observational data can reveal the geometry and trajectories of interacting twin-disc systems. Join us as we compare our polarized light observations with ALMA continuum and gas emission data and explore the different scenarios of stellar interaction." #observationaldata #stellartrajectories #astrophysics
