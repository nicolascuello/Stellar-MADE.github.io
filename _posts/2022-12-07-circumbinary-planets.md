Abstract: Context. Most of the planetary systems discovered around binary stars are located at
approximately three semi-major axes from the barycentre of their system, curiously close to low-order
mean-motion resonances (MMRs). The formation mechanism of these cir- cumbinary planets is not yet
fully understood. In situ formation is extremely challenging because of the strong interaction with
the binary. One possible explanation is that, after their formation, the interactions between these
planets and the surrounding protoplan- etary disc cause them to migrate at velocities dependent on
the nature of the disc and the mass of the exoplanet. Although extensive data can be obtained with
direct hydrodynamical simulations, their computational cost remains too high. On the other hand, the
direct n-body simulations approach allows us to model a large variety of parameters at much lower cost.  
Aims. We analyse the planetary migration around a wide variety of binary stars using Stokes-like forces
that mimic planetary migration at a constant rate. Our goal is to identify the main parameters responsible
for the ejection of planets at different resonances with the inner binary.  
Methods. We performed 4200 n-body simulations with Stokes-like forces and analysed their evolution and
outcome as a function of the properties of each system. For each simulated exoplanet, we applied an ensemble
learning method for classification in order to clarify the relationship between the inspected parameters and
the process of MMR capture.  
Results. We identify the capture probability for different N/1 MMRs, 4/1 being the most prone to capture
exoplanets, with 37% probability, followed by MMR 5/1 with âˆ¼ 23% of probability. The eccentricity of the
binary is found to be the most important parameter in determining the MMR capture of each circumbinary
exoplanet, followed by the mass ratio of the binary and the initial eccentricity of the planet.
