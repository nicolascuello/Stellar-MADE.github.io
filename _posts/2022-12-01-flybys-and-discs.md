Abstract: We examine whether stellar flyby simulations can initiate FU Orionis outbursts using 3D hydrodynamics simulations coupled to live Monte Carlo radiative transfer. We find that a flyby where the secondary penetrates the circumprimary disc triggers a 1–2 year rise in the mass accretion rate to 10−4 Msun/yr that remains high (> 10−5 Msun/yr) for more than a hundred years, similar to the outburst observed in FU Ori. Importantly, we find that the less massive star becomes the dominant accretor, as observed.
