We review the role of stellar flybys and encounters in shaping planet-forming discs around young stars, based on the published literature on this topic in the last 30 years. Since most stars ≤ 2 Myr old harbour protoplanetary discs, tidal perturbations affect planet formation. First, we examine the probability of experiencing flybys or encounters: More than 50% of stars with planet-forming discs in a typical star forming environment should experience a close stellar encounter or flyby within 1000 au. Second, we detail the dynamical effects of flybys on planet-forming discs. Pro- grade, parabolic, disc-penetrating flybys are the most destructive. Grazing and penetrating flybys in particular lead to the capture of disc material by the secondary to form a highly misaligned circumsecondary disc with respect to the disc around the primary. One or both discs may un- dergo extreme accretion and outburst events, similar to the ones observed in FU Orionis-type stars. Warps and broken discs are distinct signatures of retrograde flybys. Third, we review some recently observed stellar systems with discs where a stellar flyby or an encounter is suspected — including UX Tau, RW Aur, AS 205, Z CMa, and FU Ori. Finally, we discuss the implications of stellar flybys for planet formation and exoplanet demographics, including possible imprints of a flyby in the Solar System in the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects and the Sun’s obliquity.

This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
