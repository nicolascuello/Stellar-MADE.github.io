Accretion discs in multi-star systems can align in a polar configuration with respect to the binary plane by aligning their angular momentum to the binary eccentricity vector.

However, the precession of the eccentricity vector over time can undermine this stability, as shown in analytical and numerical simulations.

Analytically, we found that the binary criteria for polar alignment are necessary but not sufficient conditions for polar alignment in hierarchical systems (HSs).

We derived an analytical criterion for polar alignment in HSs and found that discs orbiting the innermost level of an HS can go polar, while radially extended discs orbiting the outer levels cannot.

Our results are compatible with observed distributions of disc-orbit mutual inclination and suggest that the wider range of inclinations in HSs results from the secular oscillation of their orbital parameters.
