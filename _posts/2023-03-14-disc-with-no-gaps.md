"Dust and gas in unprecedented detail!" New ALMA observations of MP Mus reveal a smooth protoplanetary disk with surprising survival of large grains.

Could there be undetected structures due to optically thick emission at 1.3 mm? Or are small structures still unresolved? We explore the possibilities in MP Mus.

Scaling relations for gap-opening planets and gap widths suggest upper limits to the masses of planets in the disk as low as 2 M⊕ -0.06 MJup at r > 40 au. How low can they go?

The lack of mm emission at radii r > 60 au suggests a shadow cast by a puffed-up inner disk, not a gap in the disk density. What secrets are hidden in the shadows?

With a radius of 60±5au, a dust mass of 0.14+0.11 MJup, and a gas mass of 0.1−1 MJup, the MP Mus disk is a treasure trove of information about planet formation.
